            I am a fullstack web developer located in beautiful Vermont. For over
            twenty years, I have spent most of my time outside living the
            snowboarder life. When off the slopes, I always wanted to dissect and
            break down everything I encoutner in my path.
            <br /><br />Ultimately, I turned to web development to satisfy this
            need. It all started when I began customizing my MySpace page with
            custom HTML and CSS made designs. Eventually, that lead to me taking
            more classes in web development, further solidifying my developer
            skills. Since then, web development and coding became some of the
            biggest passions in my life.
