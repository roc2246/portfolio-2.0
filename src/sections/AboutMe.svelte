      I am a fullstack web developer located in beautiful Vermont. For over
      twenty years, I have spent most of my time outside living the snowboarder
      life. When off the slopes, I always wanted to dissect and break down
      everything I encoutner in my path.
      <br /><br />Ultimately, I turned to web development to satisfy this need.
      It all started when I began customizing my MySpace page with custom HTML
      and CSS made designs. Eventually, that lead to me taking more classes in
      web development, further solidifying my developer skills. Since then, web
      development and coding became some of the biggest passions in my life.
